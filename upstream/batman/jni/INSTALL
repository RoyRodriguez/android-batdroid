B.A.T.M.A.N. Installation and Usage

Compiling from source
=====================

Pre-requirements
---------------

You need the usual compile environment and the libpthread-library
and the kernel module "tun". Both should already be installed on
your machine, if you use a PC with Linux. On embedded devices
both may not be installed in order to save space. GNU Make is needed
for compilation (currently BSD Make is not cooperating).

The *BSD and Mac OS operating systems are currently unmaintained,
make targets are still available but will most probably not work.
If you're interested in porting and maintaining B.A.T.M.A.N. for
these systems, please contact us. We would appreciate your help.

Compiling
---------

You don't necessarily need to compile. May be your distribution
or our download store offers precompiled packages. Check
http://www.open-mesh.net/wiki/Download to get an overview.

Download and compile the latest stable sources from the download
section http://www.open-mesh.net/wiki/Download by executing eg.:

$ wget http://downloads.open-mesh.net/batman/releases/batman-0.3.2/batman-0.3.2.tar.gz
$ tar xzvf batman-0.3.2.tar.gz
$ cd batmand-0.3.2
$ make

After the compilation process is finished you'll find a executable
file called 'batmand'. This executable is quite big because it is
not stripped. Don't strip it if you want to help us finding a bug
in the daemon. Strip it by executing:

$ strip batmand

Install by executing (as root):

$ make install

Or start it right from the directory where you compiled it by
issuing:

./batmand

See the README file for "getting started" instructions or consult the
manpage to get an overview about the command line options.
